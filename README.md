# Call of Juarez 2: Bound in Blood

Locale pack 69 for a customized cancerous multiplayer experience.

## How to Install

1. Replace ...steamapps/common/Call of Juarez 2 - Bound in Blood/CoJ2/Data/Game.ini with Data/Game.ini
2. Add Data/debugconf.scr alongside Data/Game.ini to allow joining of fake LAN games.
3. Copy Data69.pak and Speech69.pak into ...steamapps/common/Call of Juarez 2 - Bound in Blood/CoJ2

## How to Join

Add '-join ip:port' to your launch options (either on the shortcut or through Steam)
where ip is the IP Address of the server ('localhost' does not work)
and port is the port it is running on (default is 27632)

You will automatically connect to the server on launch if it is running. Otherwise nothing happens and you can play
normally.
